## Scala Basics:
* Scala Syntax is very similar to Ruby
* Scala doesn't require semicolon(;) at end of the statement i.e., optional
* Scala has the following language components:
  * Class
  * Object
  * Method
  * Function
  * Closure
  * Traits
* We do Scala programming in two days:
  * Interactive Mode
  * Script Mode
* Scala scripts or programs have an extension of ".scala"
* Scala is case sensitive
* Scala follows Java convensions
* Scala doesn't have static members
* Scala identifiers are used for object, class, method, variable names etc...
  * Legal Identifiers
    name, place, _city, _a_salary
  * Illegal Identifiers
    $name, 1place, -salary
* Scala has many language specific reserved keywords
  * case, class, object, return, if, else, etc...
* Scala supports two types comments like Java
  * Single line comments i.e., //
  * Multiline comments i.e., /*....*/
* Scala is a line-oriented language where statements may be terminated by semicolons (;) or newlines.
* In Scala, semicolon at the end of a statement is usually optional.
* Scala organizes its classes and objects in terms of packages like Java.

### Scala Hello World Program:

##### Interactive Mode:
    ``` 
    println("Hello World")
    ```
##### Script Mode:
    ``` 
    object Hello {
      def main(args:Array[String]) {
        println("Hello World")
      }
    }
```
