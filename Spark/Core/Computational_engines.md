## Distributed Computational Paradigms:

* Distributed Systems are invented to address the Scalabilty i.e., Scala Out.
* The first generation distributed computational Engines are:
  * MPI
  * MPP
  * MapReduce
* Modern Computational Engines are:
  * Storm
  * Spark
  * Flink
  * Giraph
  * Samza

* The first generation distributed systems are focused on Batch workloads.
* They were designed to address a specific set of work loads.
* They are not general purpose and high performant.
* They are designed to run on specific platforms.
* So there is scope for new computational engines with following motives:
  * General Purpose
  * Run on anywhere
  * Seamlessly Integrated with all the data sources
  * Faster and Memory oriented
  * Iterative and Expressive in nature
  * Multi-Purpose i.e., Batch, Streaming, Machine Learning, Graph processing etc..
  * Extendability/Customization
  * Easy to use i.e., Higher level abstractions.
* Modern Computational engines like Spark, Flink are having advanced processing engines at their core.
* They are capable of doing multiple things at Scale and Faster
* They are general purpose and suitable for various work loads.
