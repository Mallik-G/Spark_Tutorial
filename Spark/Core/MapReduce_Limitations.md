## MapReduce Limitations:

* Though MapReduce is large scale distributed computational paradigm, but is has the following limitations:
  * It is slow i.e., high latency and less performance
  * It is not good for Interative Computing i.e., machine learning
  * It is not good for Expressive Computing i.e., data querying
  * Difficult to code and use
  * It doesn't maintain global state
  * Less Productive
  * Limited Native Client APIs
  * It is two stage model
  * Olny for certain set of workloads
  * Only Batch processing
  * Not good for graph processing
  * Non Interactive programming model
  * No Data Caching.
  * Lengthy and Boiler plate code
  * No Abstraction like RDD, DataStream, DataSet etc...
